Directory.EnumerateDirectories and Directory.EnumerateFiles accept a parameter that allows you to specify a search condition for names to return, and a parameter to recursively traverse all child directories.
System.Environment.SpecialFolder is an enumeration that lets you access system-defined folders, such as the desktop or user profile, in a cross-platform manner without having to memorize the exact path for each operating system.
If you need to parse other file types, check out the packages on nuget.org. For example, you can use the CsvHelper @https://www.nuget.org/packages/CsvHelper package for .csv files.
